FX2 slave fifo test code - control via JTAG / USER1

top_with_la is the version with builtin logic analyzer - you need the LA code from bscan_la as well! LA is connected to USER2 ! 

xilprg usage: user 1 1 xxyyyy

xx & 0x80: write - else read
xx & 0x7f: register
yyyy     : value

example to send 1024 bytes to the host:
---------------------------------------

user 1 1 800002 -> no delay between write cycles, don't stop on full
user 1 1 810400 -> do 1024 write cycles
-> now start usb_rd and press button 0 -> you should get (0..ff)x4
